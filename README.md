# Visualizer
This is my side project where I have created a web page to depict some of the mostly used Sorting Algorithms, using bars and colours. </br> This portal can be used for educational purpose, for explaining the Algorithms to freshers. </br> Visit the portal : <a href="https://kmrsaket.github.io/Visualizer/">Algorithm Visualizer</a>

## First thing First
Here, Bars are used to represent a number in the array and it's height is proportional to the value of the element. Also, different color codes are used to distinguish between different steps involved in the algorithm.
* Initial color	- ![#A9A9A9](https://via.placeholder.com/20/A9A9A9/000000?text=+) `#A9A9A9`
* Checking Elements (Primary color)	- ![#9955dd](https://via.placeholder.com/20/9955dd/000000?text=+) `#9955dd`
* Checking Elements (Secondary color)	- ![#99dd55](https://via.placeholder.com/20/99dd55/000000?text=+) `#99dd55`
* Need to Swap	- ![#ff000d](https://via.placeholder.com/20/ff000d/000000?text=+) `#ff000d`
* Comparing Elements	- ![#808080](https://via.placeholder.com/20/808080/000000?text=+) `#808080`
* Intermediate Sorted Elements	- ![#e5e500](https://via.placeholder.com/20/e5e500/000000?text=+) `#e5e500`
* Final Sorted Array	- ![#292F33](https://via.placeholder.com/20/292F33/000000?text=+) `#292F33`
* Pivot	- ![#000000](https://via.placeholder.com/20/000000/000000?text=+) `#000000`

## How to use
Keeping freshers in mind, this webpage is designed in such a way that it's very easy to use and every functionalities are self explanatory.
